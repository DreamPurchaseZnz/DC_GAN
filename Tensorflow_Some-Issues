The pooling and convolutional ops slide a "window" across the input tensor.
Using tf.nn.conv2d as an example:
If the input tensor has 4 dimensions: 
[batch, height, width, channels], then the convolution operates on a 2D window on the height, width dimensions.




 'x' is [[1., 1. ]]
#         [2., 2.]]
tf.reduce_mean(x) ==> 1.5
tf.reduce_mean(x, 0) ==> [1.5, 1.5]
tf.reduce_mean(x, 1) ==> [1.,  2.]
indices = 1 mean get column result 
        = 0 mean get row    result
