## Small samples
this question have been proved.samll samples do nothing with convergence,but is relevant to accuracy.

## Regression
All I have done is classifying. There are still some difference in regression. so how to construst 
a reasonable structure is very important to neural network

* First step : use spectrum dataset to do regression and see the effect of the strucure
  * without conv:  just dense layer
  * with conv : there are some questions in using conv1D or con2D, in fact we should use conv1D ,however need experience 
  
* Second step : use the structure and input data to design GAN  and classifier
* compare two method and get the result
